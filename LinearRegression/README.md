#   Linear Regression
A very basic demonstration on the concept of linear regression.

### _Requirements_ : 
*   Python 2.6.x, 2.7.x, 3.2.x or newer
*   **numpy** and matplotlib (_optional_)

>   __Independent Variable__ : Input data goes in here.
>   Each line contains a floating point number
>   In this example, I've used 10000 random numbers generated from [random.org](https://www.random.org).

##  2. output.txt
>You can supply your very own output dataset similar to inputs given that they're formatted 
>the same way as the inputs and their frequencies match.
>And obviously, the outputs must have linear co-relation with the inputs and not polynomial.

## 3. generateOutput.py
>You could also use this python script to generate output datasets according to the
>the factor you provide.
```python
#set the factor of your choice 
factor = 0.81
```
## 4. linearRegression.py
>This code wouldn't require any changes, but you could certainly tweak something here and there.
